## RRSM

This R package implements several methods for reduced rank spatial models. One of the functions, `TKS`, implements the method in a manuscript recently accepted to the Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation.

Note that this package is currently in a state of "it functions properly for the creator". It will be made more user-friendly over time. Feel free to use the 'Issues' to alert the author to problems.
