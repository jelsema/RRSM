Reduced Rank Spatial Models

This [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) package implements several methods for reduced rank spatial models. One of the functions, `TKS`, implements the method in a manuscript recently accepted to the Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation.


Note that this package is currently in a state of  It will be made more user-friendly over time. Feel free to use the 'Issues' to alert the author to problems.


Notes about the package:

- RRSM is currently in a state of "it functions properly for the creator".
- Some other functions are not yet complete, though the `TKS` function at least should be fully usable.
- Over time, it will be made more friendly to wide use. In the meantime, feel free to use the 'Issues' to alert the author to problems.


## Installation

**RRSM** is not on CRAN (and there is no plan to submit to CRAN at least for some time).

The easiest installation will probably be to use `devtools::install_github`, but installation has not yet been tested other than on the author's machine. This is the first priority for the package.


## Usage

Some examples will be added here in the future, especially for the `TKS` function. 


## License

This package is provided under the GPL-3 license.
