===========================
## THE TO-DO LIST:

# GLOBAL IDEAS
- Unify the arguments a bit
  - coords : observed locations
  - knots  : selected knot locations
- Rewrite rr_em_fb to use same variable names/etc as other EM algorithms.
- Any rewrite of the kriging functions needed?


# PREDICTION
- Go through the two prediction programs (mainly, the universal kriging) and clean up the code, make sure it's correct, etc.
- Allow prediction functions to take argument of class "rr_est". This cleans up the parameters (no more V, ssq, tsq, etc.)
  - If bhat=NULL then compute bhat = GLS estimate. Otherwise use the given estimate.
  - COMPARE the kriging predictions with generic mixed model predictions. Should be the same.
- Add Bayesian methods
  - FRRSM
  - Other priors for V?
- Add another residual term, per the reviews from JASA on knot paper.


# ESTIMATION / FITTING
- Add in the programs from dissertation (MOM estimation, robust estimation and fitting, FRRSM)
- Make rr_est a CLASS have these functions produce an object of class rr_est.
- Then a single function rr_est which then CALLS the various estimation algorithms:
  - Partial EM (fixed beta)
  - EM
  - Constrained EM
  - MOM (CJ)
  - MOM (Robust)
- Give informative errors in case of insufficient arguments
- Does an iterative version of MOM, to estimate beta, work?
- Make function to estimate tau.
- More sophisticated model, dependent error structure?
- Allow 'knots' to have another dimension, to be multi-resolutional.
  - List with length = number of resolutions?
  - Additional column for resolution ID?


# MISC
- Put in some warnings for when someone tries to run blindly
  - Didn't provide knots
  - Didn't estimate parameters
  - Didn't calculate S
  - etc
- Where do these warnings go?
  - When someone tries to estimate parameters --> rr_est
  - When someone tries to predict --> rr_krige (or change to rr_predict? Yes, I think that's better)


# TESTING / VALIDATION
- Test the functions. See if things generally play well.
  - Simulate some data
  - Estimate knots
  - Estimate parameters
  - Make predictions
  - Do this for various types of models - normal, lognormal, various estimation types, etc.
- Write some programs for testing to put in RRSM/tests
