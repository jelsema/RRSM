===========================
COMMENT:

This package is, at the moment, primarily intended as a means for the author to organize
the code he has written relating to reduced rank spatial models, for the purposes of his
own use, and to share with his collaborators. It is only released in its present state
at the request of peer reviews.



===========================
## THE TO-DO LIST:

# GLOBAL IDEAS
- Unify the arguments a bit
  - coords : observed locations
  - knots  : selected knot locations
- Rewrite rr_em_fb to use same variable names/etc as other EM algorithms.
- Any rewrite of the kriging functions needed?


# PREDICTION
- Go through the two prediction programs (mainly, the universal kriging) and clean up the code, etc.
- Allow prediction functions to take argument of class "rr_est". This cleans up the parameters (no more V, ssq, tsq, etc.)
  - If bhat=NULL then compute bhat = GLS estimate. Otherwise use the given estimate.
  - COMPARE the kriging predictions with generic mixed model predictions. Should be the same.
- Add Bayesian methods
  - FRRSM
  - Other priors for V?
- Add another residual term, per the reviews from JASA on knot paper.


# ESTIMATION / FITTING
- Add in the programs from dissertation (MOM estimation, robust estimation and fitting, FRRSM)
- Make rr_est a CLASS have these functions produce an object of class rr_est.
- Then a single function rr_est which then CALLS the various estimation algorithms:
  - Partial EM (fixed beta)
  - EM
  - Constrained EM
  - MOM (CJ)
  - MOM (Robust)
- Give informative errors in case of insufficient arguments
- Does an iterative version of MOM, to estimate beta, work?
- Make function to estimate tau.
- More sophisticated model, dependent error structure?
- Allow 'knots' to have another dimension, to be multi-resolutional.
  - List with length = number of resolutions?
  - Additional column for resolution ID?


# MISC
- Put in some warnings for when someone tries to run blindly
  - Didn't provide knots
  - Didn't estimate parameters
  - Didn't calculate S
  - etc
- Where do these warnings go?
  - When someone tries to estimate parameters --> rr_est
  - When someone tries to predict --> rr_krige (or change to rr_predict? Yes, I think that's better)


# TESTING / VALIDATION
- Test the functions. See if things generally play well.
  - Simulate some data
  - Estimate knots
  - Estimate parameters
  - Make predictions
  - Do this for various types of models - normal, lognormal, various estimation types, etc.
- Write some programs for testing to put in RRSM/tests


# Following should be in the NAMESPACE prior to building (I think?)
  importFrom(Rcpp, evalCpp)

  useDynLib(RRSM, .registration=TRUE)
  exportPattern("^[[:alpha:]]+")
